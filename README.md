# School Management System API

This project is a **FastAPI-based backend API** designed for **school management** with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. It allows **CRUD-L (Create, Read, Update, Delete, List)** operations for schools and users, with authentication and authorization mechanisms in place. The system is built for the **Ministry of Education and Sports** to manage school-related data efficiently.

---

## Features
- **CRUD-L Operations** for Schools and Users.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for Admin, Manager and Users.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure access.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database interactions.
- **Alembic** for database migrations.
- **API Versioning** with `/api/v1/`.
- Automated setup using **Bash scripts** (`setup.sh` and `alembic_setup.sh`).
- Well-documented API endpoints accessible via Swagger UI.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd school-management
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
# . .venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/MacOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations
Navigate to the directory containing `alembic_setup.sh` and run:
```bash
chmod +x alembic_setup.sh  # Make the script executable
./alembic_setup.sh         # Run the script
```

### 6. Start the FastAPI Server
Navigate to the `app` directory and run:
```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

### 7. Access the API Documentation
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```
This will open the **Swagger UI** where you can interact with the API endpoints.
